            <h3>My name is Uriel, full name being Uriel San Miguel, you can say my name however you like.</h3>
            <p>At school, I enjoy PLTW, the reason I joined again, but I like to code and just read sometimes.</p>
            <p>While outside of school, I enjoy being by myself, Playing my game, or just sleeping with my cat.</p>
            <p>This year, I'm hoping to get A's in at least a good amount of my classes, but in total A's or B's.</p>
            <p>My most favorite place I've been to is San Antonio, Texas. It's my favorite because I was born there before moving to Bakersfield.</p>

            <p>One place I would like to go to is Tokyo, Japan. I want to go since I've seen videos of the places there and mostly for the flowers.</p>

            <p>My favorite board games to play are chess, for virtual games I enjoy Watch dogs, more Watch dogs 2 out of the most, Destiny 2, and Assasin's Creed.</p>

            <p>In the future, I want to either get a job for coding games, or just coding in general, or just becoming an Carpenter if I can.</p>
